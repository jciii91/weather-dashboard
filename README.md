# Weather Dashboard
Uses the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities. Weather Dashboard will show current information for the searched city as well as the 5 day forecast. There is also a search history which persists between pageloads. Clicking on a previously searched city will pull its current weather data and its 5 day forecast.
